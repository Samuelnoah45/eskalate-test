/*
Jest Testing Naming Conventions:

1. Test File Naming:
   - Test files should be named after the file they are testing, with '.test' or '.spec' appended before the file extension.
   - Example: If you're testing a component in a file named 'MyComponent.tsx', the test file should be named 'MyComponent.test.tsx' or 'MyComponent.spec.tsx'.

2. Describe Block Naming:
   - The 'describe' block should be used to group related tests.
   - The string passed to the 'describe' function should describe what you're testing. This is often the name of the component or function you're testing.
   - Example: If you're testing a 'Page' component, your 'describe' block might be named 'Page component'.

3. Individual Test Naming:
   - The 'it' function is used to define individual tests.
   - The string passed to the 'it' function should describe what the test is checking. It's often phrased as an assertion, starting with 'should'.
   - Example: 'it should render the component correctly' or 'it should call the onClick handler when clicked'.

Remember, clear and descriptive names for your test files, describe blocks, and individual tests will make your tests easier to understand and maintain.
